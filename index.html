      <h2>1. Behind the Scenes</h2>
      <p>
        The development of <strong>Shadow Platformer</strong> began as a personal challenge to recreate the nostalgic experience of classic Mario-style games using Unreal Engine. My aim was to create a basic but fully playable platformer game with features like jumping, enemy interaction, and coin collection ‚Äî while improving my skills in visual scripting and level design.
      </p>
      <p>
        I used Unreal Engine 5, relying mainly on Blueprints for logic and controls. I began by designing the player movement system: horizontal movement, gravity-based jumping, and collision with platforms. After that, I added interactive elements like coins, power-ups, and simple enemies that patrol specific areas.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the course of three weeks, I invested roughly 20‚Äì25 hours into learning, building, and testing. I followed tutorials, experimented independently, and referred to the Unreal community for debugging help. All assets were sourced from free or royalty-free platforms, with a few minor sprite modifications to personalize the look.
      </p>
      <p>
        The feedback I received from classmates and lecturers was encouraging. They highlighted the polish of the movement system and the game‚Äôs responsiveness. Their suggestions, such as adding background music or fine-tuning enemy timing, helped me refine the final build.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Outcome</h2>
      <p>
        The final result was a fully playable prototype of a 2D side-scrolling platformer titled <strong>Shadow Platformer</strong>. Key features include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Character Control: Smooth left/right movement, jump mechanics, and ground collision.</li>
        <li>Level Design: A complete level with platforms, gaps, spikes, coins, and a finish goal.</li>
        <li>Enemies: Simple patrol logic using Blueprints; enemies damage the player on contact.</li>
        <li>UI: On-screen coin counter, health bar, and start/restart menus.</li>
        <li>Sound: Background music and sound effects for jumping, collecting, and enemy contact.</li>
        <li>Exportable Build: Game can be packaged and played as a standalone .exe file for Windows.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The game successfully demonstrates the core experience I set out to build ‚Äî fast-paced platforming with clear feedback and consistent logic. I also created promotional assets, including gameplay clips and screenshots, which I plan to use on my portfolio and social platforms.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Reflection</h2>
      <p>
        Working on <strong>Shadow Platformer</strong> deepened my understanding of Unreal Engine and game design in general. Even though it appears simple, building a platformer required attention to timing, hitboxes, animation syncing, and state management.
      </p>
      <p><strong>What worked well:</strong>  
        The use of Blueprints allowed me to iterate quickly and visualize logic flows. My movement system felt responsive, and collision behavior was solid. I was also pleased with the simple enemy AI and how it added life to the level.
      </p>
      <p><strong>What didn‚Äôt work initially:</strong>  
        Early in development, jump physics felt floaty and inconsistent. I also struggled with layering the background and tiles correctly, which caused visual glitches. Enemy logic also failed at times, with pathing bugs and overlap events triggering at the wrong times.
<section>
  <h2>üõ†Ô∏è Challenges Faced During Development</h2>
  <p>One of the main bugs I encountered was the player character falling off the map. This usually happened due to missing collisions or gaps between platforms.</p>
  <p>I attempted to fix it by:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Adding invisible boundary walls or kill zones to respawn the player.</li>
    <li>Improving collision detection on platforms.</li>
    <li>Adjusting gravity and jump strength in the Blueprint settings.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This helped me better understand how Unreal Engine handles physics and level design, and improved my problem-solving skills.</p>
</section>

      </p>
      <p><strong>How I overcame challenges:</strong>  
        I revisited the Blueprint logic and broke it into smaller, testable parts. I also learned about collision channels and began using debug visuals to identify problem areas. Through iteration, community feedback, and self-testing, I improved performance and game flow.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project taught me the importance of <strong>modular design</strong>, <strong>clear logic</strong>, and <strong>playtesting</strong>. It also boosted my confidence in using Unreal Engine for 2D game development. In the future, I aim to explore more advanced systems like health regeneration, multiple levels, and even simple boss fights ‚Äî potentially expanding the project or starting a new one in Unity or Godot for comparison.
